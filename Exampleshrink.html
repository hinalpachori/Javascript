        <p>Home computers were a class of microcomputers that entered
             the market in 1977 and became common during the 1980s.
              They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible 
              computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use 
              of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct
               market segment that typically cost much less than business,
                scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time
                 such as those running CP/M or the IBM PC,[2] and were generally 
                 less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However
                 , a home computer often had better graphics and sound than
                  contemporary business computers. Their most common uses
                   were playing video games, but they were also regularly
                    used for word processing and programming.</p>

           <p> Home computers were usually sold already manufactured in stylish metal 
               or plastic enclosures. However, some home computers also came as commercial
                electronic kits like the Sinclair ZX80 which were both home and home-built
                 computers since the purchaser could assemble the unit from a kit.</p>
